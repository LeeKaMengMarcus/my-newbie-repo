# Your Project's Name
MY-NEWBIE-REPO

The project topic that i have chosen is to create a resume site to summaries me in general. The site mainly covers my capabilities and works that i have done. It is also a way to promote my resume to others when this site gets published to "sell" myself. This will be frequently updated as i have more works that are presented or crafted and lets people view and see my work process.

## Design Process

This site focuses on building a personal portfolio and to present the best to recruiters who are considering to hire the applicant. 

The wireframes can be found in the same folder of this file while it can also be accessed with this link (https://xd.adobe.com/view/37d74bbc-f48a-4190-88ca-d83057b160d9-6284/)

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

The pages should all look the same on different screens as i think it looks the best with this layout even with a computer screen and horizontal screen on the phone.

There is no particular bugs that i have found yet. Therefore, if any would be discovered, please inform me.
